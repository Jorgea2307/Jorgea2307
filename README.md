** add some more notes lie the example below**

If you'd like to see some examples of the interesting custom SQL I have written to get my data formatted properly in Tableau, you can do that here. If you're more interested in the Python scripts that I have written to clean, generate, and document data at my job, you can find that here.

If you'd like to leave GitHub and check out my Tableau skills, you can do so here.

My Blog is a good place to get to know my story.
